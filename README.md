## Plotting the mileage of cars dataset filtered by cylinder and gears

In this presentation, we will look into below factors:

- Plotting mileage of the cars in kilometers with HP based on Cylinder
- Plotting mileage of the cars in kilometers with HP based on Cylinder and gears
- Also the miles are computed into kilometers during runtime
- Kilometers are calculated by multiplying (*1.60) to miles.

This helps us to understand the effect of cylinders and gears on mileage of the cars.

## Input, Files and Options:

- User have the option to select the Cylinders
- User have the option to select the Gears
- Plot changes as per user inputs

Dataset used : mtcars (dataset that comes in R)

The repository consists of three files:

- ui.R
- server.R
- README.md
